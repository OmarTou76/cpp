# C++ Pool Projects

This repository contains my C++ pool projects from 42 School, developed using C++98. These projects cover a wide range of topics related to the C++ programming language, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more. Each project is designed to enhance my understanding and proficiency in C++.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions!
